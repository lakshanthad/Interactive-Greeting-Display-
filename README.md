# Interactive Greeting Display

How would you greet someone at a party or event? Just say “Hello, nice to meet you. Have a great evening!”. But how can you make this greeting more interesting? Well….The Digital Greeting Display is the solution. It can light up and show a greeting message when you give a handshake or high five to someone you meet. The touch sensor attached to the palm of your hand can trigger the display when it comes in contact with the other person’s palm. Pretty cool hah!
